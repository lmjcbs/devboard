# devboard

devboard is my Flatiron School JavaScript project. devboard is a SPA used to display jobs of all varieties for developers looking for their next opportunity. Users can see all positions, search for a particular position based on a keyword, or filter positions by location, category or technology.

## Installation

First clone the respository 
```
git clone https://github.com/lmjcbs/devboard

```
From inside the devoboard directory, navigate to the devboard-api directory for the backend.
Here you'll need to run `rake db:setup` to load the database and seed it.
Next you'll need to run the server with `rails server`.

Once the server is working correctly, navigate to the devboard-frontend for the index.html file, which is the entry point for this SPA.
